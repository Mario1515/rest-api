# RESTful Furniture Shop API

![Furniture Shop Logo](https://your-logo-url-here.com)

**RESTful Furniture Shop API** was a Node.js and Express.js project that served as the backend for a simulated furniture shop. This project demonstrated RESTful principles and included features for managing products, customers, and orders. The frontend, created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, was designed to interact with this API.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Supported Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for products, customers, and orders.
- **Authentication**: Secured API endpoints with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Password Hashing**: Hashed user passwords with Bcrypt for security.
- **Database**: Utilized MongoDB as the database backend with Mongoose for easy data modeling.
- **CORS**: Handled Cross-Origin Resource Sharing with the CORS npm package.
- **RESTful Design**: Adhered to REST principles for a logical and predictable API structure.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Bcrypt (Password hashing)
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

## Project Structure

The project directory structure was organized as follows:

- `client/` - Contained the frontend of the application created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- `server/` - The backend server implemented with Node.js and Express.
- `models/` - Database schemas were defined using Mongoose.
- `routes/` - API route definitions and controllers.
- `config/` - Configuration files for JWT and other settings.
- `middleware/` - Custom middleware functions.
- `public/` - Static files (if applicable).
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts.
- `app.js` - The entry point for the Express application.
