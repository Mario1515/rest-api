**RESTful Furniture Shop API** is a Node.js and Express.js project that serves as the backend for a simulated furniture shop. This project demonstrates RESTful principles and includes features for managing products, customers, and orders.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for products, customers, and orders.
- **Authentication**: Secure your API endpoints with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed with Bcrypt for security.
- **Database**: Utilize MongoDB as the database backend with Mongoose for easy data modeling.
- **CORS**: Handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing with the CORS npm package.
- **RESTful Design**: Adheres to REST principles for a logical and predictable API structure.

## Technologies Used
